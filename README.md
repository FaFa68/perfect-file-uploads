# Perfect Server Side Swift File Uploads example

This example is in part based on Kyle Jessup's File Upload Enumerator.

It was my scratchpad for learning a bit about the nuts and bolts of the file uploads and 
getting some familiarity with the Perfect Mustache templater.

Check out the Perfect repo at https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect for 
instructions on how to get up and running with Swift 3 and Perfect 2.

The easiest way to run this:

Fork or check out, then either `swift build` in terminal, or open in Xcode 8 beta 2 or later, and build/run.

Note: there are 2 "schemes" in Xcode, the app and the commandline. Build the command line version 
(the one that looks like the terminal icon) and run it.

Then, access on http://localhost:8181

LMK if any questions!
